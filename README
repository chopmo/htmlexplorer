== Introduction
This is a very simple app to help test out different Nokogiri search
expressions. The target page is cached to speed things up. 

I created this project as a tool to experiment with different CSS
selectors for some screen scraping tasks I'm working on.

== Gem dependencies 
Bundler >= 0.9.7

== Installation and startup
bundle install
rake db:migrate
script/server

== Usage
Point a browser at http://localhost:3000 and follow the instructions

== Ideas for improvements 
 * Live result updates (ie. after a short while of inactivity in the text field)
 * Make it possible to clear pages from the cache (ie. force reload)
