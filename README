This is a very simple app to help test out different Nokogiri search expressions. No error checking or the like. 

I created this project as a tool to experiment with different CSS selectors for some screen scraping tasks I'm working on. 

Ideas for improvements: 
 * Async page loads
 * Live result updates (ie. after a short while of inactivity in the text field)
